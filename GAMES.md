# My wishes for modern games

## Optional online features

Many modern AAA games now fully rely on online networking to run even singleplayer parts of games, my wish is for the developers of these games to reduce the online requirement to only the parts of games that actually need it.

This way games can be preserved like before, without having to resort to practices like piracy.

## Optimize games for lower end systems

Many games are no longer properly optimized, and instead get rushed for release. 
Because of that, those games run badly on lower end systems, and sometimes even the platforms they are intended to be played for.


## More adoption of HDR in games

With HDR displays becoming more common, I want more games to properly adopt it as well. HDR can be a way to increase clarity and allow for better looking environments, while not degrading performance.
