<h1>My wishes for modern games</h1>
<h2>Optional online features</h2>
<p>
  Many modern AAA games now fully rely on online networking to run even
  singleplayer parts of games, my wish is for the developers of these games to
  reduce the online requirement to only the parts of games that actually need
  it.
</p>
<p>
  This way games can be preserved like before, without having to resort to
  practices like piracy.
</p>
<h2>Optimize games for lower end systems</h2>
<p>
  Many games are no longer properly optimized, and instead get rushed for
  release. Because of that, those games run badly on lower end systems, and
  sometimes even the platforms they are intended to be played for.
</p>
<h2>More adoption of HDR in games</h2>
<p>
  With HDR displays becoming more common, I want more games to properly adopt it
  as well. HDR can be a way to increase clarity and allow for better looking
  environments, while not degrading performance.
